values:
  - heading: Locally Grown
    text: We value locally grown food. Buying local supports local farmers (and
      thereby supporting the local Jackson economy). It means fresher, more
      nutritious food for you and your family, and typically means less
      environmental damage.

  - heading: Relationships
    text: We like to know who grows the food we eat. We like to know the families
      that are supported by our purchases, know the land that the food is grown
      on. This isn't generic grocery store food. Each of our farmers and the
      food they produce mean something.

  - heading: Regenerative Farming
    text: >
      Regenerative agriculture is a conservation and rehabilitation approach to
      food and farming systems. It focuses on topsoil regeneration, increasing
      biodiversity, improving the water cycle, enhancing ecosystem services,
      supporting biosequestration, increasing resilience to climate change, and
      strengthening the health and vitality of farm soil. We support and promote
      regenerative agriculture, and source from as responsible sources as
      possible.

  - heading: Resilience
    text: Resilience is the ability of a system (like a community) to absorb
      disturbance and still retain basic function and structure. A key component
      of community resiliency is access to food. By supporting local farms, we
      build the resiliency of our communities.
