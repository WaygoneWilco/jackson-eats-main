blurb:
  heading: Why Jackson Eats?
  text: We are building the local food economy in Jackson. We offer you local
    foods while we offer local farmers fair prices for their products. This
    benefits everyone - you receive healthy, quality food, farmers receive a
    steady income, and money stays in our local communities. Better food for
    your family, better living for local farmers.

  heading: What we offer
  text: Our core offerings are locally grown produce, pasture raised meat, local
    maple syrup and honey, and regionally grown grains and beans. We source as
    much of our offerings from local farmers as possible, but bring in products
    to round out our offerings.

  heading: Our values
  text: Agriculture is a defining feature of human civilization, and we are
    working to change how it works in our local area. This means supporting
    farmers to create healthier food, for the land and for people. And this
    means making it easy for people to buy and receive this food.
