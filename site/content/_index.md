  heading: Why Jackson Eats?
  text: We are building the local food economy in Jackson. We offer you local
    foods while we offer local farmers fair prices for their products. This
    benefits everyone - you receive healthy, quality food, farmers receive a
    steady income, and money stays in our local communities.
intro:
  heading: What we offer
  text: Locally grown produce, grains, beans, maple syrups, oil... We have a
    selection of the most popular items. We are working with local farmers to
    provide as much of our offerings as possible, so availability is dependent
    on our farmers and our suppliers.

  heading: Our values
  text: Agriculture is a defining feature of human civilization, and we are
    working to change how it works in our local area. This means supporting
    farmers to create healthier food, for the land and for people. And this
    means making it easy for people to buy and receive this food.
